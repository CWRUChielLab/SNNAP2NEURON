This simulation reproduces the model published 
in:

Cataldo E, Byrne JH, Baxter DA
Computational Model of a Central Pattern Generator
Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics (2006, in press)




Example use:

Start SNNAP (double click on the SNNAP.jar file)
click on "Run Simulation"
Then in the new window "File"->"Load Simulation"
browse to and load rBMP.smu file to load a simulation
that creates a figure similar to Fig.5 from the paper and click "Start"
See http://snnap.uth.tmc.edu/ to download SNNAP
